# Startup-Website-Project---Bask-it-
This is a payment processing website and shopping companion, allowing users to organize items they want to buy, track prices, and share lists with others for birthdays, parties, and other occasions that I designed and developed using Wix for a startup that did not launch. While the company did not go live, the site served as a prototype for the concept and branding.
